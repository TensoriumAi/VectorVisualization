# Project Plan and Roadmap for Embedding Visualization App

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a self-contained Node.js application for loading, managing, and visualizing high-dimensional embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT). The application will provide interactive visualizations, dimensionality reduction techniques, and extensive customization options. It will maintain a local database and download necessary models and datasets from the web, persisting them locally. A comprehensive testing framework will ensure the reliability of all internals.
