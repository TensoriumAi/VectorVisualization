### Error: ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope

**Problem:**
The project was configured for ES modules, but server code and webpack config used CommonJS syntax.

**Resolution:**
1. Remove `"type": "module"` from `package.json`.
2. Keep using `require` in `server/app.js` and `webpack.config.js`.
3. Update Babel and Jest configurations to support both module systems.

This allows the project to use CommonJS syntax by default while supporting ES6 imports in React components.

### Error: TypeError: dataManager.initDatabase is not a function

**Problem:**
The `initDatabase` method was missing from the `DataManager` class, causing the server to fail on startup.

**Resolution:**
1. Added the `initDatabase` method to the `DataManager` class in `DataManager.js`.
   - The method initializes the SQLite database by creating the necessary tables.
2. Ensured `DataManager` is properly exported and required in `app.js`.
3. Verified that `dataManager.initDatabase()` is called before starting the server.
